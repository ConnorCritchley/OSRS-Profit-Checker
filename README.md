# OSRS-Profit-Checker
A small amateur personal program to play around with API pulls to gather real time prices for items in Old School Runescape. 

# This program requires the python requests module as a dependency.

## What It Does
It will fetch the recent high and low trade prices for items within the data.json file, average them, and use that for calculating profit through preprogrammed methods. It is scalable, any item added to the json file will be checked and can have its price printed. 

## Potential Updates
Should I have the time, I can easily add a user input for adding new items to the data without manual file editing. A larger commitment would be the ability to add a profit method within the program, promting the user for an end result item its ingredients.
